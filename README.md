# Twine Launcher

Self-hosted Twine game library with cross-device save sync, multi-user support, and role-based access control. Available as a **Docker container** (for servers and home labs) and a **Windows desktop app**.

## Features

- **Save sync** — localStorage data is persisted server-side and restored on every launch, across any device or browser
- **Multi-user** — each user has their own independent save data per game
- **Role-based access** — Admin and Player roles; admins manage the library, users, sessions, and backups
- **Single-instance enforcement** — only one browser tab per game at a time; prevents save conflicts
- **Force-close sessions** — admins can close any active session from the dashboard
- **Backup / restore** — export full (game files + saves) or saves-only backups as portable zip files
- **Themes** — 5 built-in themes plus custom JSON upload; global default set by admin, users can override personally
- **Windows desktop app** — installs like any Windows program; Steam style system tray — library always running in background; open and close the window independently; no browser required

## Quick Start (Docker)

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/yourname/twine-launcher
cd twine-launcher

# 2. Drop your Twine HTML files into games/
mkdir -p games/my-game
cp my-game.html games/my-game/index.html

# 3. Build and run
docker compose up -d --build

# 4. Open http://localhost:8080
#    First visit triggers the setup wizard to create your admin account.
```

## Quick Start (Windows Desktop)

1. Download the latest `Twine Launcher_x.x.x_x64-setup.exe` from the [Releases page](../../releases)
2. Run the installer
3. Launch **Twine Launcher** from the Start Menu
4. The library starts in the system tray — the window opens automatically once ready (~5 seconds)
5. Complete the setup wizard to create your admin account
6. Add games via the Library page (Admin → Library → Add Game)

**Window vs. library**: closing the window (× button) dismisses the UI but keeps the library running in the tray — like closing the Steam window. Click the tray icon (or relaunch from Start Menu) to reopen the window instantly, with no startup delay.

**Game and save data** are stored in `%AppData%\com.twinelauncher.desktop\`.  
**To exit the library fully**, right-click the tray icon and select Quit.

## Development Setup

### Backend

```bash
# Install uv (https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)
uv sync

# Run backend (games served from ./games, DB at ./data/twine_launcher.db)
TWINE_GAMES_DIR=./games TWINE_DATABASE_URL="sqlite:///./data/twine_launcher.db" \
  uvicorn backend.app.main:app --reload

# Run tests
TWINE_GAMES_DIR=/tmp/games python -m pytest backend/tests/ -v
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
yarn install
yarn dev   # proxies /api to localhost:8000
```

### Windows Desktop App

Prerequisites: Node.js, Python (with `uv`), Rust toolchain, Tauri CLI (`cargo install tauri-cli --version "^2" --locked`).

**Must be run on Windows** — PyInstaller cannot cross-compile.

```powershell
# Install dev dependencies (includes PyInstaller)
uv sync --extra dev

# Generate app icons from a 1024x1024 source image
cd desktop
cargo tauri icon path\to\source.png
cd ..

# Build everything (frontend → PyInstaller sidecar → NSIS installer)
python build_desktop.py

# Installer output:
# desktop\src-tauri\target\release\bundle\nsis\Twine Launcher_x.x.x_x64-setup.exe
```

## Roadmap

### Short term

- [ ] Prepare to upload on Winget
- [ ] Software update mechanism

### Long term

- [ ] Web-based game sources (add a game by URL; launcher fetches and caches the HTML, injects a `<base href>` so external assets resolve correctly, and serves it same-origin so save sync works unchanged)
- [ ] Git-based game sources (add games by GitHub/GitLab URL)
- [ ] Playnite library add-on
- [ ] Accessible quick settings when inside a game
- [ ] Per-game settings
- [ ] Windows desktop shortcuts for individual games
- [ ] Multiple users playing the same game simultaneously
